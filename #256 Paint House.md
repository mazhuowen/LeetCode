There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a $n \times 3$ cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house $0$ with color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house $1$ with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.



**Note**:
All costs are positive integers.
