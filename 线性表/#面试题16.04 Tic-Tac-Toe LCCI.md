Design an algorithm to figure out if someone has won a game of tic-tac-toe. Input is a string array of size $N \times N$, including characters `" "`, `"X"` and `"O"`, where `" "` represents a empty grid.

The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

* Players place characters into an empty grid(`" "`) in turn.
* The first player always place character `"O"`, and the second one place `"X"`.
* Players are only allowed to place characters in empty grid. Replacing a character is not allowed.
* If there is any row, column or diagonal filled with $N$ same characters, the game ends. The player who place the last charater wins.
* When there is no empty grid, the game ends.
* If the game ends, players cannot place any character further.

If there is any winner, return the character that the winner used. If there's a draw, return `"Draw"`. If the game doesn't end and there is no winner, return `"Pending"`.



**Example 1**:

```
Input:  board = ["O X"," XO","X O"]
Output:  "X"
```

**Example 2**:

```
Input:  board = ["OOX","XXO","OXO"]
Output:  "Draw"
Explanation:  no player wins and no empty grid left
```

**Example 3**:

```
Input:  board = ["OOX","XXO","OX "]
Output:  "Pending"
Explanation:  no player wins but there is still a empty grid
```



**Note**:

* $1 \le \text{board.length} == \text{board[i].length} \le 100$
* Input follows the rules.



## 题目解读

&emsp;给定井字棋棋局，判定局势。

```java
class Solution {
    public String tictactoe(String[] board) {
        
    }
}
```

## 程序设计

* 统计记录行、列、两个对角线的棋子数目即可。

```java
class Solution {
    public String tictactoe(String[] board) {
        int n = board.length;
        // 行、列与两个对角线O的数目
        int[] record = new int[2 * n + 2];
        // 是否还有空位
        boolean empty = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String str = board[i];
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int val = getVal(str.charAt(j));
                if (val == 0) empty = true;

                record[i] += val;
                record[n + j] += val;
                if (i == j) record[2 * n] += val;
                if (i + j == n - 1) record[2 * n + 1] += val;
            }
        }

        for (int count : record) {
            if (count == n) return "O";
            if (count == -n) return "X";
        }
        return empty ? "Pending" : "Draw";
    }

    private int getVal(char c) {
        if (c == 'O') return 1;
        if (c == 'X') return -1;
        return 0;
    }
}
```
