There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a $n \times k$ cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house $0$ with color $0$; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house $1$ with color $2$, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.



**Note**:
All costs are positive integers.



**Follow up:**
Could you solve it in $O(nk)$ runtime?
