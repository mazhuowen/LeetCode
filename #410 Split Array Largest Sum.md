Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.

Note:
If n is the length of array, assume the following constraints are satisfied:

* $1 \le n \le 1000$
* $1 \le m \le \min(50, n)$
