Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make `arr1` strictly increasing.

In one operation, you can choose two indices $0 \le i < \text{arr1.length}$ and $0 \le j < \text{arr2.length}$ and do the assignment $\text{arr1[i]} = \text{arr2[j]}$.

If there is no way to make `arr1` strictly increasing, return `-1`.



Constraints:

* $1 \le \text{arr1.length, arr2.length} \le 2000$
* $0 \le \text{arr1[i], arr2[i]} \le 10^9$
