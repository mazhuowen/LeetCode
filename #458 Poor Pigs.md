There are `1000` buckets, one and only one of them is poisonous, while the rest are filled with water. They all look identical. If a pig drinks the poison it will die within `15` minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket is poisonous within one hour?

Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the general case.

 

**General case**:

If there are $n$ buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within $m$ minutes, how many pigs (`x`) you need to figure out the **poisonous** bucket within $p$ minutes? There is exactly one bucket with poison.

 

**Note**:

* A pig can be allowed to drink simultaneously on as many buckets as one would like, and the feeding takes no time.
* After a pig has instantly finished drinking buckets, there has to be a **cool down time** of m minutes. During this time, only observation is allowed and no feedings at all.
* Any given bucket can be sampled an infinite number of times (by an unlimited number of pigs).
