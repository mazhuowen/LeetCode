Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r rows and c columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.

"off limits" and empty grid are represented by `1` and `0` respectively.

Return a valid path, consisting of row number and column number of grids in the path.



**Note:**

- $r, c \le 100$
