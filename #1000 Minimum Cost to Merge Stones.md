There are `N` piles of stones arranged in a row.  The `i`-th pile has `stones[i]` stones.

A move consists of merging **exactly** `K` **consecutive** piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these `K` piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible, return -1.



**Note:**

- $1 \le \text{stones.length} \le 30$
- $2 \le K \le 30$
- $1 \le \text{stones[i]} \le 100$
