Given two lists of **closed** intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

(Formally, a closed interval `[a, b]` (with $a \le b$) denotes the set of real numbers $x$ with $a \le x \le b$.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.)



Note:

* $0 \le \text{A.length} < 1000$
* $0 \le \text{B.length} < 1000$
* $0 \le \text{A[i].start, A[i].end, B[i].start, B[i].end} < 10^9$
