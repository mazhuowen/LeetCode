[toc]

In a given integer array `A`, we must move every element of `A` to either list `B` or list `C`. (`B` and `C` initially start empty.)

Return true if and only if after such a move, it is possible that the average value of `B` is equal to the average value of `C`, and `B` and `C` are both non-empty.



Note:

* The length of `A` will be in the range `[1, 30]`.
* `A[i]` will be in the range of `[0, 10000]`.
