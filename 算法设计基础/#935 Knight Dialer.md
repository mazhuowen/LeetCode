A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

 <img src="../images/#935_0.png" style="zoom:67%;" /> <img src="../images/#935.png" style="zoom:120%;" />

This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad (indicated above), and the knight makes `N-1` hops.  Each hop must be from one key to another numbered key.

Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight), it presses the number of that key, pressing `N` digits total.

How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?

Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.



**Note:**

- $1 <= N <= 5000$
