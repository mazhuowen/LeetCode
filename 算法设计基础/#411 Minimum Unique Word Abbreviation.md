A string such as `"word"` contains the following abbreviations:

```
["word", "1ord", "w1rd", "wo1d", "wor1", "2rd", "w2d", "wo2", "1o1d", "1or1", "w1r1", "1o2", "2r1", "3d", "w3", "4"]
```


Given a target string and a set of strings in a dictionary, find an abbreviation of this target string with the **smallest possible** length such that it does not conflict with abbreviations of the strings in the dictionary.

Each **number** or letter in the abbreviation is considered length = 1. For example, the abbreviation `"a32bc"` has length = 4.

Note:

* In the case of multiple answers as shown in the second example below, you may return any one of them.
* Assume length of target string = **m**, and dictionary size = **n**. You may assume that $m \le 21$, $n \le 1000$, and $log_2n + m \le 20$.
