Given an array of integers `A` and let `n` to be its length.

Assume `Bk` to be an array obtained by rotating the array `A` k positions clock-wise, we define a "rotation function" `F` on `A` as follow:

$$
F(k) = 0 * B_k[0] + 1 * B_k[1] + ... + (n-1) * B_k[n-1]
$$
Calculate the maximum value of `F(0)`, `F(1)`, ..., `F(n-1)`.



Note:
`n` is guaranteed to be less than $10^5$.
